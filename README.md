# Starter sketch repository
This repository is a collection of code snippets and wiring diagrams of interactive sketches that mainly leverages the Arduino platform to explore different inputs, outputs, and behaviours. 

## Structure
The sketches are divided into three folders:

- [**Inputs**](/inputs/): a series of starter sketches where different components are used to get an input. You can use these skethces as a starting point to get data from the component of your choice.
- [**Outputs**](/outputs/): a series of starter sketches where a value is used to drive a component. You can use these sketches to see how data translates to the chosen output.

- [**Input-Output sketches**](/input-output/): ready-made code snippets where an input and an output are combined to create a behaviour.

## Info on the repository
This repository is curated by employees in the [IOIO Lab](https://ioiolab.se/) at MalmÃ¶ University. 

> IMPORTANT! Sketches might be based on code from other sources. When that is the case, the original source will be specified in at the top of the code file.
